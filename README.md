# Python-Projects
Many different small projects that I've done in python.
Two of them were wxPython practices, so I used them mostly to design GUIs and see what that was about.
Animalkinator guesses which animal you're thinking of based on some questions, kinda like the famous 'akinator' site does with characters. It actually works exactly the same way, except it does not have such a big database (here I just hardcoded a few animals into it).
The rest are just some OOP practice I did to get the basics of python's object syntax.
